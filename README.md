# A-realistic-dual-oscillator-model-of-circadian-rhythms
Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations with a period close to 24h, which modulates different physiological and behavioral processes in all the living organisms.In mammals, the circadian clock consists of activators ( Clock and Bmal1 ) that activates the repressors ( per and cry ), which in turn, after a delay, suppresses the activity of the activators and thereby inhibiting its own production. A single cell dual morning and evening oscillator was proposed by Daan et al., based on the molecular network that has two sets of similar non-redundant per1/cry1 and per2/cry2 circadian genes and each can independently maintain their endogenous oscillations.Here I am presenting a minimal mathematical model with the assumption that per1 gene acts a morning oscillator and per2 gene acts as an evening oscillator.
